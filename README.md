Binomial heaps are data structure which uses binomial trees to perform standard heap operations. In addition to binary heap they provide O(1) merging of two heaps, which is in fact O(N) in binary heap. Your task is to build a binary heap with all the standard heap functions and a merge function which works in O(1) time.
